> Write down one thing we could **do differently next time**

* Real world fixes with stats! :)
* Provide a little bit more "note-making" paper like A5 writing pads. Even just one per table =).
* Use a good example and explain why it's good.
* Aircon off from beginning (if it is not too hot). Thanx so much :)
* This is what I loved:
  * instructions / information on where to park
  * audience participation (as lame as that seems)
  * timeline.
* Very well structured, thanks! Maybe ask users *briefly* about their own background / experience.
* Struggling to think of one... (was v. v. good :) ). *or* share names / contacts of delegates (optional) CTFEDs is a good networking event...
* Make meetup title describe meetup. I firth thought it was a cancellation or help request or something.
* Describe the meetup content / agenda / level in the description. (My place should have gone to a beginner as I know all this stuff)
* Good map instructions! :)
