# Ideas to consider for the next run

* SMART goal: switch for [Hey, buddy](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/activities.html#heybuddy). Optional swap, explain why it's a good idea.
* Too many small things next to each other at the end: break it up a bit. Something that involves movement.
* Make sure the questions are more specific. "What are three things you already know about UX for e-commerce?" Add prompt: something really bad or really good.
* Split presentation in two pieces, activity in the middle.
* Recap content and outline at start of workshop.
* Introductions. Once everyone's in, do an intro self (plus something else) activity.
* Name tags!
* Too short. During the week should be much more focused, or longer one at the weekend?
* Have links to stats and case studies.
* Show real world examples. Annotate screenshots, with principles?
* Include a feedback section. Us walking around more, "present" to the table.
* Scribble paper.
* More subtle problems didn't bubble up. Narrow scope: just one screen? #changethegame. Fix it, then improve it.
* Remind people that they can use the meetup for contacts.
* Add a "level" / pre-requisites mini-blurb.
